    "## Evals\n",
    "\n",
    "- Cost of A/B testing > cost of model-based and human evals > cost of unit tests\n",
    "- Cadence: unit-tests after each code change, model-based + human evals with some cadence, A/B tests after major changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Unit tests\n",
    "\n",
    "- Assertions like in pytest\n",
    "- In more places: data cleaning and automatic retries (using assertions to course-correct) during inference.\n",
    "- Should be fast to run often.\n",
    "- To come up with unit tests:\n",
    "    - Think about your traces and the failure modes they incur.\n",
    "    - Ask your model to brainstorm.\n",
    "- Step 1: write scoped tests\n",
    "    - Break down the scope into features and scenarios\n",
    "    - For example, one feature of Lucy is to find real estate listings, for example: \"Find listings with more than 3 bedrooms and less than $2M in San Jose, CA\"\n",
    "    - The assertion verifies that the expected **number of results** is returned, scenarios: \n",
    "        - only one listing, more than one listing, no listing.\n",
    "    - Generic tests: do not include UUID of user in response.\n",
    "- Step 2: create test cases:\n",
    "    - Inputs that trigger each of the scenarios.\n",
    "    - Use synthetic inputs based on LLM. \n",
    "    - If possible, write both instructions for obtaining the response as well as instructions for verifying the result. \n",
    "        - For example \"write 50 different instructions that a real estate agent can give to his assistant to create contacts on his CRM. For each of the instructions, generate a second instruction to look up the created contact\". \n",
    "        - For each of the test cases, we execute the first user input to create the contact and then execute the second to fetch the contact. If the result length is not exactly 1, the test fails.\n",
    "    - One signal the tests are good is when the model struggles to pass them.\n",
    "    - You don't need 100% pass rate.\n",
    "- Step 3: run and track your tests regularly.\n",
    "\n",

    "    - At least read traces for all test cases and all user-generated traces. Sample over time.\n",
    "- Automated Evaluation with LLMs\n",
    "    - Have humans periodically evaluate a sample of traces. \n",
    "        - Track correlation between human and model evaluations.\n",
    "    - Collect \"critiques\" from labelers explainig why they are making a decision. \n",
    "        - Use them for prompt engineering and fine tuning of the LLM evaluator.\n",

    "    - A way to verify that the generated queries actually trigger the intended dimensions.\n",
    "- It is key that synthetic data is grounded in real system constraints:\n",
    "    - real listings, real agent schedules, restricting business rules, including local regulations, etc.\n",
    "- If we don't have production data because the product is new, use LLMs to generate both test queries and test data.\n",
    "    - Use realistic attributes \n",
    "        - prices that match market conditions, valid addresses with real street names, etc.\n",
    "- Guidelines for using synthetic data:\n",
    "    - Diserify dataset: cover all dimensions.\n",
    "    - Generate user inputs, not outputs: realistic user queries, not LLM responses.\n",
    "    - Incorporate real system constraints: use real data and business rules.\n",
    "    - Verify dimension coverage: ensure generated queries trigger intended dimensions.\n",
    "    - Start simple then add complexity: begin with basic queries, then introduce edge cases."
