    "    - Use log-probs, see if they get high as we add examples and stop adding when it saturates.\n",
    "- Where to put those examples\n",
    "    - As system messages makes them high priority but sometimes we want to put them at the bottom close to the end.\n",
    "        - In this case, we may want to add another *fake* system message after the user one, but the model could get confused in this case. We need to try and evaluate.\n",
    "- Other hyper-parameters:\n",
    "    - When doing evals, use number of completions higher than one to get many possible outputs for the same case so we get a better picture of the type of response we can get. This needs to be done with temperature higher than 0 (but lower than 1).\n",
    "- Getting structure in the message:\n",
    "    - My note: LangChain tackles this at the moment. However, the recommendation from this talk is to not ask to provide an overly complicated structure such as copying and pasting an entire API into the prompt.\n",
    "    - Same about passing very complicated objects (such as nested dictionaries of nested dictionaries and so on) to function tools.\n",
    "- If you have sloppy code the model will probably produce similar style of sloppy (following bad practices) code.\n",
    "- DSP may do a good job of figuring out what are the best examples in few shot learning.\n",
    "- Worth learning about \"*react*\" and \"*reflect*\" as potential techniques aside from chain of thought and few shot. \n",
    "    - The former is the pattern supported in LangChain.\n",
    "    - The latter is to ask \"are you sure this is the right answer\" so that the model does everything in its hands to check the correctness and injects any errors / issues about this answer back to the prompt asking to learn from those mistakes and provide a more accurate answer. It does so several times in a loop and gets a final solution that tends to be much better."
